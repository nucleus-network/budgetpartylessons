<p><strong>What is Budget Party?</strong></p>
<p>Budget Party is an open-source and interactive participatory budgeting game that helps people learn more about how the Austin city budget is created, have some fun while doing so. You can play the <a href="https://austinbudget.party/home">Budget Party Game</a> for free online and check out the <a href="https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty">Budget Party Repo</a> for more information. </p> 
<p><strong>Who created Budget Party?</strong></p>
<p>Budget Party was developed by Open Austin in partnership with the Austin Monitor, Mozilla, and an Austin ISD educator.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Budget Party Curriculum?</strong></p>
<p>The Budget Party Curriculum is a set of interactive lessons developed for high school students. The goal of these lessons is to help students learn more about the city of Austin's budget, how it is formed, and how it impacts people's daily lives in Austin. The curriculum was initially written by AISD educator Laurie Beaman. Sarah Morris from Nucleus Learning Network is adapting and editing this curriculum for GitHub and use beyond Austin.
