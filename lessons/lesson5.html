            <ol>

              Scaffolding and Resources 
            </h2>
             <p>
             In previous lessons learners explored both individual and city budgets more generally and the Austin city budget more specifically. They applied their knoweldge and understanding to creating their own budgets. In this lesson, learners will finalize their budgets and prepare to share their budgets with an audience through an oral presentation and with an infographic.

             <li> Groups will re-convene to share and prioritize departments for their budget before they begin their
final decisions. They will use the “Fight for Funding” warm up to rank which departments they think are most
important to give funding to first, and how those departments represent the need of their local districts.</li>
       
            </ul>

<li>Groups will log in to the Budget Party game and make
decisions about each department based off of their priorities set up in their warm-up and their research from
  previous days. </li>
   <li>They will use the Finalizing Your Budget table to record their final choices.</li>
<li>On this table, they will note what they increase and decrease to meet final budget standards as they play along
with the game. Encourage them to start with their priorities warm-up- and use it as a place to take notations about
what they are doing on the actual game. Groups should not record their final decisions until they have made all
  adjustments in the game and are ready to submit.</li>
