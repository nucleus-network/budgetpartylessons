            <ul>
              <li>Divide learners into groups.</li>
        <li> Learners will read the Austin Fact Sheet, a general introduction about the city of Austin, its local government, and some of the current statistics that will be relevant to this project.</li>
              <li>Learners will write down 10 fast facts about Austin and will sort their facts into categories, such as tourism or public safety. </li>
              <li>Learners will answer questions on their Austin Fact Sheet Worksheet which require them to further examine what they learned about Austin, the perspective that was shared, and trends and themes found throughout the report.</li>
              <li>Have learners discuss and share their findings.</li>
              <li>Tip: have learners read aloud to each other to facilitate understanding.</li>
       
            </ul>

            <ul>
       <li>Learners will look at multiple articles that offer perspectives from local leaders on the budget and its challenges. The first article (Council Confronts Touch Budgeting Decisions) will be examined by the entire class. Learners will answer questions about the article. </li>
<li>Learners will get back in their groups and will look at four articles that offer additional insight surrounding Austin’s budget. Each student will read a different article and become an expert on their reading, while completing the Article Jigsaw worksheet. </li>
 <li>Learners will share their findings with their group members, and they will all work together to answer the culminating questions in their Jigsaw worksheet. </li>

            <ul>
              
           <li>With their groups, students will look at the City of Austin dashboard. This will be a key tool for them to use as they are planning their budget in future classes.

           <li> Learners will begin to look at the budget game that they will play over the next class periods by logging on to the website in their groups and beginning to browse its features. Over the next class periods, they will work with their cooperative learning group to create a budget that they think best fits Austin’s needs. </li>
           <li>In their groups they will get a base familiarity with the budget game platform, its features, how to access different parts of the budget, and how they will begin to build their own.
