            <p>
              In this lesson, learners will:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
             <li>Finalize the creation of their budget presentation and budget infograhpic.</li>
              <li>Share their budget and their infographic with their peers</li>
             <li>Reflect on their learning.</li>

            </ol>

              Scaffolding and Resources 
            </h2>
             <p>
             In previous lessons learners applied their knoweldge and understanding to creating their own budgets. In this lesson, learners will share their budgets with an audience through an oral presentation and with an infographic. 
            </p>

            <h2>
              Preparation Instructions and Facilitation Tips 
            </h2>
            
            <p>
           You can print out the worksheets and information packets or have your learners view and complete them online depending on your technology situation.  
           </p>
<p>
  Divide your learners into cooperative learning groups to complete the activities.

             Warm-Up Activity 1 - 10 minutes
            </h3>
            
            <ul>
            
             <li> Collaborative groups will re-convene and remember their budget work from the previous class by coming up
               with a list and defining their group’s core values based on their budget decisions.</li>
              <li>They will fill in five sentences that start with “We believe...." "Therefore....” These sentences will reflect the decisions they made in their budget, almost like a
                “budget platform”. </li>
              <li>They will then come up with a catchy phrase that also reflects the main priorities/”platform”
behind their budget. They will turn this in with their infographic.</li>
       
            </ul>

            <ul>
            
              <li>Groups will be allotted time to review, finalize and work on their presentations. </li>
              <li>Tip: You may want to give them a list of helpful hints for effective presentations if you do not regularly have them present in your class. </li>
   

            </ul>

            <ul>
             
      <li> Each group will take approximately five minutes to present their infographic that they have created that clearly
        presents their budget decisions.</li>
              <li>As they present, their peers will note which items of the budget they gave
                priority to in funding and which they chose to make cuts from. </li>
              <li>At the end, students will complete a silent ballot
in which they select a group (with clear reasoning for their selection) that had the best budget.</li>

            </h3>

            <ul>
            <li> Learners will reflect on what they have learned from this project on three index cards that they place on the
board or on poster paper that they can write on like a “chalk talk” around the room. They will be guided by three
questions.</li>

             <ol>
               <li>What is something you will take away from this project?</li>
                 <li>What is something you learned about the city that you did not know before?</li>
               <li>How has this project helped you become a more informed resident of your city?</li>

             <ul>
               
               <li>The group voted to have the best budget and presentation can be selected to be the class representative for an extension activity. This group will further their project experience
through “advancing” to present their budget to selected groups from ten different local campuses. This will take place
through a videoconference hosted by either a Skype session, Google Hangout, or a similar platform. Students
involved in this video conference will abide by Roberts Rules of Order and share and discuss their budget
                 decisions in a council like session to present their views.</li>
