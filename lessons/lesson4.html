              Learning Progression 
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              In this lesson, learners will:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
             <li>Explore, critically examine, and discuss complex issues and debates in the city of Austin and how those isues impact the budget.</li>
             <li>Continue working on their budget project using the online Budget Party game.</li>
              <li>Use research and critical thinking skills to develop and explain the reasoning behind their budget decisions.</li>
             <li>Reflect on their learning.</li>

            </ol>
            
             <h2>
              Scaffolding and Resources 
            </h2>
             <p>
             In previous lessons learners explored both individual and city budgets more generally and the Austin city budget more specifically. They applied their knoweldge and understanding to creating their own budget, with an initial focus on public safety issues. In this lesson, learners will continue to develop their budget projects and focus on additional areas and departments in the city.

              Preparation Instructions and Facilitation Tips 
            </h2>
            
            <p>
           You can print out the worksheets and information packets or have your learners view and complete them online depending on your technology situation.  
           </p>
<p>
  Divide your learners into cooperative learning groups to complete the activities.

             <h3>
             Warm-Up Activity 1 - 20 minutes
            </h3>
            
            <ul>
            
             <li> Students will read statements about services provided by the City of Austin and evaluate their personal beliefs about these services using a worksheet.</li>
              <li>The services listed are directly correlated to the different departments that the City of Austin provides money to in its budget.</li>
           <li>   After they finish the exercise, read each statement aloud. Have each learner stand in a differnet corner based on their opinion. </li>
              <li>Have a few people in each group share their reasoning. </li>
       
            </ul>
            
              <h3>
              Activity 2 - 55 minutes
            </h3>
           
            <ul>
            
             <li>Have everyone return to their groups and get into the Budget Party game online.
               <li>Have groups break up the remaining sections of the budget based on what interests them the most. There are 12 remaining departments to examine broadly under four sections (there are a few with more than one department to help provide equity in work distribution). </li>
Students will use the resources provided to them in prior lessons as well as the Budget Party game to make informed and justified changes to the budget allocation for their assigned section/departments. As they
review this information, they will fill in the corresponding sections of the Budget Party worksheet, which they will
              use to share key details with other members of their group. </li>

            </ul>
         
            
          <h3>
            Activity 3 - 10 minutes 
           </h3>

            <ul>
             
      <li>  Learners will return to the Warm-Up Activity worksheet and will match each of the statements to a department
researched by members of their group. For each statement, students will work together to share and explain how
it relates to the budget, and then they will share their first decisions about whether they think that department
should receive an increase or decrease in funding and why. This will serve as a base for the final decisions they
        make as a group in the next class.</li>

            </h3>

            <ul>
            <li> Have everyone rank the departments in the section that they researched that they think should have priority in the final budget. On their worksheet, have them put a #1 next to the department that
absolutely should receive an increase in funding, a #2 next to the department that may need an increase in funding, and a #3 next to the department which should have least priority in the final budget.</li>
<li>Then have them fill out two sentences to turn in.
The department (in the section that I researched) that would most benefit
from a budget increase is [blank] because [blank].
The department (in the section that I researched) that we could
  potentially make cuts in the budget for is [blank] because [blank]. </li>
